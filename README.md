# [Try it out!](https://zacharybanken.github.io/SubtizingGame/)

This is a cross-platform app I made to learn how to use React Native and expo. The app demonstrates the concept of [subtizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing) and short-term memory.

Known issues: 
- keyboard input on web version
- expo vector icons not loading in gh-pages published site
